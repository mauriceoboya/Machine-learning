## Linear Regression
Linear regression measures the relationship between the dependent and the independent variable; The influence on the independent variable has on the dependent variable. It can either be a simple or multiple linear regression, that is, a simple linear regression if the dependent variable is influenced by a single independent variable(one to one ) and multiple if influenced with more than one features

$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon$

where:
   y= is the dependent variable, x's independent varibles and $\epsilon$ the error term
